# Bahrain_imports
As part of the collaborative team project “Manamas-log,” we analyzed Bahrain’s import data over the last five years using datasets sourced from data.gov.bh. Our focus was on foodstuff imports, identifying key trends, supply chain dynamics, and market opportunities. We developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to deliver actionable insights through effective visual storytelling.
